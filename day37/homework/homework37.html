        <h1>Sea Horse</h1>
        <p>A seahorse (also written sea-horse and sea horse) is any of 46 species of small marine bony fish in the genus
            Hippocampus. "Hippocampus" comes from the Ancient Greek hippókampos (ἱππόκαμπος), itself from híppos (ἵππος)
            meaning "horse" and kámpos (κάμπος) meaning "sea monster"[4][5] or "sea animal".[6] Having a head and neck
            suggestive of a horse, seahorses also feature segmented bony armour, an upright posture and a curled
            prehensile tail.[7] Along with the pipefishes and seadragons (Phycodurus and Phyllopteryx) they form the
            family Syngnathidae.</p>
