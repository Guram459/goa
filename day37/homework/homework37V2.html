        <p>Sea turtles (superfamily Chelonioidea), sometimes called marine turtles,[3] are reptiles of the order
            Testudines and of the suborder Cryptodira. The seven existing species of sea turtles are the flatback,
            green, hawksbill, leatherback, loggerhead, Kemp's ridley, and olive ridley.[4][5] Six of the seven sea
            turtle species, all but the flatback, are present in U.S. waters, and are listed as endangered and/or
            threatened under the Endangered Species Act.[6] All but the flatback turtle are listed as threatened with
            extinction globally on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The flatback turtle is found only in the
            waters of Australia, Papua New Guinea, and Indonesia.[7][6]

            Sea turtles can be categorized as hard-shelled (cheloniid) or leathery-shelled (dermochelyid).[8] The only
            dermochelyid species of sea turtle is the leatherback.[8</p>
