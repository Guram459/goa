        <p>Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. As an informal
            and colloquial grouping, they correspond to large members of the infraorder Cetacea, i.e. all cetaceans
            apart from dolphins and porpoises. Dolphins and porpoises may be considered whales from a formal, cladistic
            perspective. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed
            ungulates. Their closest non-cetacean living relatives are the hippopotamuses, from which they and other
            cetaceans diverged about 54 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and
            toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have had their last common ancestor around 34 million years ago.
