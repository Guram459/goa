        <h1>shellfish</h1>
        <p>Shellfish, in colloquial and fisheries usage, are exoskeleton-bearing aquatic invertebrates used as food,
            including various species of molluscs, crustaceans, and echinoderms. Although most kinds of shellfish are
            harvested from saltwater environments, some are found in freshwater. In addition, a few species of land
            crabs are eaten, for example Cardisoma guanhumi in the Caribbean. Shellfish are among the most common food
            allergens.[1]

            Despite the name, shellfish are not fish.[2] Most shellfish are low on the food chain and eat a diet
            composed primarily of phytoplankton and zooplankton.[3] Many varieties of shellfish, and crustaceans in
            particular, are actually closely related to insects and arachnids; crustaceans make up one of the main
            subphyla of the phylum Arthropoda. Molluscs include cephalopods (squids, octopuses, cuttlefish) and bivalves
            (clams, oysters), as well as gastropods (aquatic species such as whelks and winkles; land species such as
            snails and slugs).

            Molluscs used as a food source by humans include many species of clams, mussels, oysters, winkles, and
            scallops. Some crustaceans that are commonly eaten are shrimp, lobsters, crayfish, crabs and barnacles.[4]
            Echinoderms are not as frequently harvested for food as molluscs and crustaceans; however, sea urchin gonads
            are quite popular in many parts of the world, where the live delicacy is harder to transport.[5][6]</p>
