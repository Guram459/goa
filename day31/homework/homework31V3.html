        <h1>Joel Coen</h1>
        <p>Joel Daniel Coen (born November 29, 1954)[1] and Ethan Jesse Coen (born September 21, 1957),[2] together
            known as the Coen brothers (/ˈkoʊən/), are an American filmmaking duo. Their films span many genres and
            styles, which they frequently subvert or parody.[3] Among their most acclaimed works are Blood Simple
            (1984), Raising Arizona (1987), Miller's Crossing (1990), Barton Fink (1991), Fargo (1996), The Big Lebowski
            (1998), O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000), No Country for Old Men (2007), A Serious Man (2009), True Grit
            (2010) and Inside Llewyn Davis (2013).

            The brothers generally write, direct and produce their films jointly, although due to DGA regulations, Joel
            received sole directing credit while Ethan received sole production credit until The Ladykillers (2004),
            from which point on they would be credited together as directors and producers; they also shared editing
            credits under the alias Roderick Jaynes. The duo started directing separately in the 2020s, resulting in
            Joel's The Tragedy of Macbeth (2021) and Ethan's Jerry Lee Lewis: Trouble in Mind (2022) and Drive-Away
            Dolls (2024). They have been nominated for 13 Academy Awards together, plus one individual nomination for
            each, sharing Best Original Screenplay for Fargo, and Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted
            Screenplay for No Country for Old Men. They won the Palme d'Or for Barton Fink at the 1991 Cannes Film
            Festival.

            The Coens have written films for other directors, including Sam Raimi's Crimewave (1985), Angelina Jolie's
            World War II biopic Unbroken (2014) and Steven Spielberg's Cold War drama Bridge of Spies (2015). They
            produced Terry Zwigoff's Bad Santa (2003) and John Turturro's Romance and Cigarettes (2005). Ethan is also a
            writer of short stories, theater and poetry.</p>
