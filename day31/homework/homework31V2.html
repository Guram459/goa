        <h1>Quentin Tarantino</h1>
        <p>Quentin Jerome Tarantino (/ˌtærənˈtiːnoʊ/; born March 27, 1963) is an American filmmaker, actor, and author.
            His films are characterized by stylized violence, extended dialogue often featuring much profanity, and
            references to popular culture. His work has earned a cult following alongside critical and commercial
            success; he has been named by some as the single most influential director of his generation and has
            received numerous awards and nominations, including two Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards, and four Golden
            Globe Awards.

            Tarantino began his career with the independent crime drama film Reservoir Dogs (1992). His second film, the
            crime drama Pulp Fiction (1994), was a major success and won numerous awards, including the Cannes Film
            Festival's Palme d'Or and the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. He next wrote and starred in the
            action horror film From Dusk till Dawn (1996). His third film as director, the crime drama Jackie Brown
            (1997), paid homage to blaxploitation films.

            Tarantino wrote and directed the martial arts films Kill Bill: Volume 1 (2003) and Kill Bill: Volume 2
            (2004), with both volumes combined regarded as a single film. He then made the exploitation-slasher film
            Death Proof (2007), which was part of a double feature with From Dusk till Dawn director Robert Rodriguez,
            released under the collective title Grindhouse. His next film, Inglourious Basterds (2009), followed an
            alternate account of World War II. He followed this with Django Unchained (2012), a slave revenge Spaghetti
            Western which won him his second Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. His eighth film, The Hateful
            Eight (2015), was a revisionist Western</p>
