        <h1>Gore Verbinki</h1>
        <p>His first films were a series of 8 mm films called The Driver Files c. 1979, when he was a young teen. After
            graduating from film school at UCLA, he got his first job as a script reader at the commercial production
            company Limelight in 1987. After director Julien Temple viewed some of his work, he signed to his production
            company Nitrate Films, and later Palomar Pictures,[5] where he directed music videos for bands like Vicious
            Rumors, Bad Religion, NOFX, 24-7 Spyz and Monster Magnet. Verbinski moved from music videos to commercials,
            where he worked for many brand names including Nike, Coca-Cola, Canon, Skittles and United Airlines. One of
            his most famous commercials was for Budweiser, featuring frogs who croak the brand name. For his efforts in
            commercials, Verbinski won four Clio Awards and one Cannes Advertising Silver Lion.

            After completing a short film, The Ritual (which he both wrote and directed), Verbinski made his feature
            film directing debut in 1997 with Mouse Hunt, which became a global hit. Following that film's success,
            Verbinski planned and developed several aborted projects; The Sky Is Falling,[6] Mission to Mars,[7] Where
            the Wild Things Are,[8] The Big Ticket,[9] The Light Princess[10] and an unpublished manuscript by William
            Monahan titled The Lighthouse.[11]

            Verbinski returned in 2001 with the action/comedy The Mexican, starring Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt. The
            film received mixed reviews, and performed modestly at the box-office, earning $68 million domestically
            which was quite meager considering its star power (it was technically successful due to its moderately low
            $38 million budget). Verbinski followed it up with the horror film remake The Ring (2002), which struck gold
            globally, grossing well over $200 million worldwide. Verbinski also had a directorial hand in The Time
            Machine that year, temporarily taking over for an exhausted Simon Wells.[12] Verbinski directed some of the
            underground Morlock sequences[citation needed] and is given a "Thanks to" credit in the film.

            He then directed the very successful Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl which earned
            over $600 million at the international box office. This was his first collaboration with producer Jerry
            Bruckheimer, whom he has since collaborated with on several other movies. His next film was The Weather Man,
            which starred Nicolas Cage. The film received mixed to positive reviews but was a box office failure. In
            March 2005, he started filming the sequels Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and Pirates of the
            Caribbean: At World's End. The former then became his biggest success so far, becoming the third film ever
            to gross over $1 billion at the international box office. In 2008, Verbinski's Blind Wink production company
            signed a deal with Universal.[13] Verbinski was also set to direct a film for Universal based on the video
            game BioShock.[14] However, budgetary and creative disputes stemming from Verbinski's wish to incorporate a
            functioning underwater rail transport system, driven by his noted fascination with trains, derailed
            development. Verbinski was then replaced by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo as director and the film was
            subsequently cancelled.[15]</p>
