        <h1 class="noto-1">Google</h1>
        <p class="osw-1">Google LLC (/ˈɡuːɡəl/ ⓘ, GOO-gəl) is an American-based multinational corporation and technology
            company
            focusing
            on online advertising, search engine technology, cloud computing, computer software, quantum computing,
            e-commerce, consumer electronics, and artificial intelligence (AI).[9] It has been referred to as "the most
            powerful company in the world"[10] and is one of the world's most valuable brands due to its market
            dominance,
            data collection, and technological advantages in the field of AI.[11][12][13] Google's parent company,
            Alphabet
            Inc., is one of the five Big Tech companies, alongside Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft.

            Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by American computer scientists Larry Page and Sergey Brin while
            they
            were PhD students at Stanford University in California. Together, they own about 14% of its publicly listed
            shares and control 56% of its stockholder voting power through super-voting stock. The company went public
            via
            an initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of
            Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet's internet
            properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry
            Page,
            who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.[14]</p>
