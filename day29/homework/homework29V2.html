            <p class="qld-1">1985. Thomas Curry, a simple lighthouse keeper in Forgiveness Bay, Maine , during a storm
                pulled a wounded blonde girl from the water, who introduced herself as Atlanna, the queen of Atlantis.
                After
                some time, Tom and Atlanna began to feel sympathy for each other, which grew into love. They have a son
                named Arthur, who has the ability to communicate with sea creatures. One day, Atlantis soldiers burst
                into
                Tom and Atlanna's house, demanding that she go with them. Atlanna fought them off, but she understood
                that
                in order to protect her beloved man and son, she must return home - to the underwater kingdom. Atlanna
                entrusts her advisor and loyal friend Nuidis Vulko with the mission of training Arthur.

                2018. A year after Steppenwolf's defeat , Arthur confronts pirates who have captured a Russian
                Akula-class
                submarine . Their leader, Jesse Kane, is killed in a failed attempt to assassinate Arthur, and his son
                David
                vows revenge. While Arthur spends time with his father and reaps the rewards of a hero at a local bar,
                his
                brother Orm allies with the king of the underwater kingdom of Xebel Nereus, faking an attack on the very
                submarine at their meeting place. Orm's goal is to subjugate all the kingdoms of the Seven Seas and gain
                the
                ancient title of "Ocean Lord" in order to wage war on the surface world.

                Mera, the daughter of Nereus and Orm's "betrothed", does not share his desire for war and decides to go
                to
                the surface to ask Arthur for help, but is refused. When Orm and Nereus initiate a mass release of
                garbage
                from the ocean onto land, which entails a monstrous tsunami that almost kills his father, Arthur
                nevertheless agrees to go with Mera. Finding himself in Atlantis, which turns out to be a high-tech
                city-state, Mera brings Arthur to Vulko, who is hiding from "prying eyes" in an air pocket in a sunken
                galleon. There, the royal adviser tells the history of Atlantis and that the only way to stop Orm is the
                Trident of Atlan. Arthur's goal is to find the trident and use it to stop the war. The meeting of
                Arthur,
                Mera and Vulko was interrupted by border guards and Orm's warriors. Mera and Vulko successfully escaped
                and
                did not reveal their connection with Arthur, but he himself was arrested.

                Orm blames his chained brother for Atlanna's death. He offers Arthur the chance to leave forever, but
                Arthur
                challenges him to a duel in a ring of underwater lava. Orm gains the upper hand and nearly kills Arthur
                before Mera saves him. Arthur and Mera travel to the fallen Deserter Kingdom hidden beneath the Sahara
                Desert where the Trident was forged and discover a holographic message that leads them to Sicily, Italy,
                where they receive the coordinates of the Trident.</p>
