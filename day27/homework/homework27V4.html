    <h1 class="h-1">Lee, Jet</h1>
    <p id="p-1">He went to school at the age of eight and was the oldest in his class. The teachers liked him because he
        often helped teach physical education classes . After the first grade, Jet and his students were sent to a
        sports camp for the summer , where he began to study wushu . Later, Li admitted that he got into the wushu
        section not on purpose, but completely by accident [ 4 ] . After the holidays, all the children were dismissed,
        and Li - the only one of his peers - was strongly recommended to continue studying wushu. From that moment on,
        training became daily. After going through several stages of selection, in 1972 he got to the national wushu
        championship and won the "Best Master" prize. After this victory, he was released from classes at a regular
        school, and Li began to spend most of his time in the gym, honing his skills.

        In 1974, a new round of selection among wushu athletes was held in China, choosing the best of the best. As a
        result, the National Wushu Team of the country was formed, which included 30 people, including Li. The team was
        assigned to represent the PRC in the USA . This trip, according to Li himself, occupies a special place in his
        life [ 5 ] . Before the trip, all athletes were given detailed instructions on what they can do in the States
        and what is not recommended. In particular, they were warned about the possibility of wiretapping and
        surveillance. In the USA, Li tried to check for "bugs" himself: while in an American hotel room, he took turns
        approaching a vase, a mirror, a telephone and loudly said that he wanted chocolate, ice cream and fruit. Jet
        left the room for a while, and when he returned, he saw that everything he asked for was on the table [ 6 ] .
        During the trip to the USA, the Chinese athletes were looked after by dozens of CIA agents , State Department
        employees and police officers . Lee's speeches were noted by President Richard Nixon himself [ 6 ] . Seeing the
        luxurious life of people in the West was a cultural shock for Lee; communicating with Americans, he noted that
        they were "friendly and could hardly be enemies." From that time on, his worldview began to change [ 7 ] .

        After returning to his homeland, Li took part in the first National Youth Wushu Championships (1974). He won
        first place in the all-around and dao sword routines . Li began to be trained by the best martial artists in
        China. In 1975, at the age of 12, Li was sent to the qualifying tournament for the Third National Wushu
        Championships. He won five out of five possible disciplines (his opponents were adult athletes). That same year,
        Li won four gold medals at the Third Championships in Beijing ( all-around , bare-knuckle routine, spear
        routine, and dao sword routine ).

        In 1976-1977, the Chinese team went on a world tour: athletes demonstrated wushu techniques in different
        countries. As a "trusted" person and a famous athlete, the Chinese authorities began inviting Li to state
        banquets and meetings with foreign delegations. Visiting demonstration performances were also held in Great
        Britain in 1979.

        In 1977, Li won first place in the Dao sword routine at the National Wushu Competition , and was also unrivaled
        among the Long Fist style practitioners . In 1978, Li won gold again (in the all-around, bare-handed routine,
        and Dao sword routine). In 1979, at the Fourth China Wushu Championship, he won the all-around , Long Fist
        style, bare-handed routine, Dao sword routine, and exhibition matches.

        In 2009, Jet Li received Singaporean citizenship and renounced his Chinese and American citizenship (which he
        had obtained after a long period of working in the United States), as Singapore does not allow</p>
